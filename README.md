# MNIST-digits-KNN
The classifiers weâ€™ve used so far can divide the data space into relatively simple shapes. The k- nearest neighbor can deal with very complex shapes. One of the challenges of doing k-nearest neighbor is that it is pretty slow and takes up a lot of memory.
The National Institute of Standards had high school students write the digits 0-9. These were scanned into 28 by 28 black and white images. This data set is known as MNIST, and it is a really common machine learning task.
There are 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
